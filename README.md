This is a programming language & editor for my little one.
He like to type things and hear the computer speak them out loud.
It helps him find letters on the keyboard, practice his spelling,
see how fun programming is.

The underlying language is super simple.
Everything is a string.
There is one operator: `*'.
It is used like this: "hello world * 3".
This will repeat the phrase "hello world" three times.

Implementation
===============
We use the Speech Synthesis API supported by most browsers.
See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisUtterance

Previously, when I had a working Mac, I would be able to use the "say" command
do this this from the command-line.
